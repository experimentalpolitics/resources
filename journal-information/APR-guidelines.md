This journal is a member of the [Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE)](http://publicationethics.org/about).  

## Manuscript Submission Guidelines: 

Manuscripts, an abstract, and 4-5 key words should be submitted electronically at http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/apr, where authors will be required to set up an online account in the SAGETRACK system powered by ScholarOne. Articles should be the equivalent of approximately 25 typewritten, double-spaced pages with endnotes, references, tables, and figures on separate pages. Research notes should be approximately 10 pages in length. Except in unusual circumstances, submissions in excess of 45 pages will not be reviewed. Authors should closely follow the [Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association](https://apastyle.apa.org/products/publication-manual-7th-edition). Since manuscripts are reviewed anonymously, authors should avoid any identifying text references. Submission of a manuscript implies commitment to publish in the journal. Authors submitting manuscripts to the journal should not simultaneously submit them to another journal, nor should manuscripts have been published elsewhere in substantially similar form or with substantially similar content. Authors in doubt about what constitutes prior publication should consult the editor.

### Code Ocean Trial

Through 2019 American Politics Research is running a trial with [Code Ocean](https://codeocean.com/). Authors can upload the code associated to their published article so that readers can view and execute it. The platform, which is based on Docker, hosts the code and data in the necessary computational environment and allows users to re-run the analysis in the cloud and reproduce the results, bypassing the need to install the software. A link to the code, data and computational environment will be included in the journal article enabling readers to seamlessly access and reproduce the code or rerun it against their own inputs. Please visit [this](https://www.sagepub.com/research-data-sharing-policies#Code%20Ocean%20Trial) page for more information and instructions for how to utilise this service for your article. If you wish to use this service, please upload your code as soon as possible after receiving an acceptance letter, to ensure the code can be linked to your article during the production process.

### Manuscript Preparation

Manuscripts should be prepared using the [Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association](https://apastyle.apa.org/products/publication-manual-7th-edition) with all pages typed, double-spaced (including references and endnotes). Text must be in 12-point Times Roman. Block quotes may be single-spaced. Must include margins of 1 inch on all the four sides and number all pages sequentially.

The manuscript should include four major sections (in this order): Title Page, Abstract, Main Body, and References.

Sections in a manuscript may include the following (in this order): (1) Title page (including abstract), (2) Keywords, (3) Text, (4) Notes, (5) References, (6) Tables, (7) Figures, and (9) Appendices.

1. Title page. Please include the following:

    Full article title
    Abstract (150 to 250 words). Omit author's names.

2. Text. Begin article text on a new page headed by the full article title.

    a. Headings and subheadings. Subheadings should indicate the organization of the content of the manuscript. Generally, three heading levels are sufficient to organize text. Level 1 heading should be Centered, Boldface, Upper & Lowercase, Level 2 heading should be Flush Left, Boldface, Upper & Lowercase, Level 3 heading should be Indented, boldface, lowercase paragraph heading that ends with a period, Level 4 heading should be Indented, boldface, italicized, lowercase paragraph heading that ends with a period, and Level 5 heading should be Indented, italicized, lowercase paragraph heading that ends with a period.

    b. Citations. For each text citation there must be a corresponding citation in the reference list and for each reference list citation there must be a corresponding text citation. Each corresponding citation must have identical spelling and year. Each text citation must include at least two pieces of information, author(s) and year of publication. Following are some examples of text citations:

    (i)Unknown Author: To cite works that do not have an author, cite the source by its title in the signal phrase or use the first word or two in the parentheses. Eg. The findings are based on the study was done of students learning to format research papers ("Using XXX," 2001)
     

    (ii) Authors with the Same Last Name: use first initials with the last names to prevent confusion. Eg.(L. Hughes, 2001; P. Hughes, 1998)

    (iii) Two or More Works by the Same Author in the Same Year: For two sources by the same author in the same year, use lower-case letters (a, b, c) with the year to order the entries in the reference list. The lower-case letters should follow the year in the in-text citation. Eg.Research by Freud (1981a) illustrated that…
     

    (iv) Personal Communication: For letters, e-mails, interviews,and other person-to-person communication, citation should include the communicator's name, the fact that it was personal communication, and the date of the communication. Do not include personal communication in the reference list. Eg.(E. Clark, personal communication, January 4, 2009).
     

    (v) Unknown Author and Unknown Date: For citations with no author or date, use the title in the signal phrase or the first word or two of the title in the parentheses and use the abbreviation "n.d." (for "no date"). Eg. The study conducted by of students and research division discovered that students succeeded with tutoring ("Tutoring and APA," n.d.).

3. Notes. If explanatory notes are required for your manuscript, insert a number formatted in superscript following almost any punctuation mark. Endnote numbers should not follow dashes ( — ), and if they appear in a sentence in parentheses, the endnote number should be inserted within the parentheses. The endnotes should be added at the bottom of the page after the references. The word “Endnotes” should be centered at the top of the page.

4. References. Basic rules for the reference list:-

    The reference list should be arranged in alphabetical order according to the authors’ last names.
    If there is more than one work by the same author, order them according to their publication date – oldest to newest (therefore a 2008 publication would appear before a 2009 publication).
    When listing multiple authors of a source use “&” instead of “and”.
    Capitalize only the first word of the title and of the subtitle, if there are one, and any proper names – i. e. only those words that are normally capitalized.
    Italicize the title of the book, the title of the journal/serial and the title of the web document.
    Manuscripts submitted to APR should strictly follow the APA manual (6th edition), including references.
    Every citation in text must have the detailed reference in the Reference section.
    Every reference listed in the Reference section must be cited in text.
    Do not use “et al.” in the Reference list at the end; names of all authors of a publication should be listed there.

Here are a few examples of commonly found references. For more examples please check APA (6th Ed).

(*section removed for brevity*)

IMPORTANT NOTE: To encourage a faster production process of your article, you are requested to closely adhere to the points above for references. Otherwise, it will entail a long process of solving copyeditor’s queries and may directly affect the publication time of your article. In case of any question, please contact the journal editor at costas@post.harvard.edu

5. Tables. They should be structured properly. Each table must have a clear and concise title. When appropriate, use the title to explain an abbreviation parenthetically. Eg. Comparison of Median Income of Adopted Children (AC) v. Foster Children (FC). Headings should be clear and brief.

6. Figures. They should be numbered consecutively in the order in which they appear in the text and must include figure captions. Figures will appear in the published article in the order in which they are numbered initially. The figure resolution should be 300dpi at the time of submission.

IMPORTANT: PERMISSION- The author(s) are responsible for securing permission to reproduce all copyrighted figures or materials before they are published in APR copy of the written permission must be included with the manuscript submission.

7. Appendices. They should be lettered to distinguish from numbered tables and figures. Include a descriptive title for each appendix (e.g., “Appendix A. Variable Names and Definitions”).Cross-check text for accuracy against appendices.

### SUPPLEMENTAL DATA

Authors are also encouraged to submit supplemental data along with their manuscripts. As supplemental data only appear online as complimentary information to the manuscript content, anything from additional tables, figures, detailed data sets, movie clips and audio files is considered supplemental. Although supplemental data does not necessarily need to be mentioned within the submitted manuscript, please make sure to inform the journal editor of this once the manuscript has been accepted for publication. Questions can be directed to the journal editor.

### SAGE Choice

If you or your funder wish your article to be freely available online to nonsubscribers immediately upon publication (gold open access), you can opt for it to be included in SAGE Choice, subject to the payment of a publication fee. The manuscript submission and peer review procedure is unchanged. On acceptance of your article, you will be asked to let SAGE know directly if you are choosing [SAGE Choice](https://www.sagepub.com/sage-choice). To check journal eligibility and the publication fee, please visit SAGE Choice. For more information on open access options and compliance at SAGE, including self/author archiving deposits (green open access) visit [SAGE Publishing Policies](https://www.sagepub.com/publishing-policies) on our Journal Author Gateway.

### ORCID

As part of our commitment to ensuring an ethical, transparent and fair peer review process SAGE is a supporting member of ORCID, the Open Researcher and Contributor ID. ORCID provides a unique and persistent digital identifier that distinguishes researchers from every other researcher, even those who share the same name, and, through integration in key research workflows such as manuscript and grant submission, supports automated linkages between researchers and their professional activities, ensuring that their work is recognized.

The collection of ORCID iDs from corresponding authors is now part of the submission process of this journal. If you already have an ORCID iD you will be asked to associate that to your submission during the online submission process. We also strongly encourage all co-authors to link their ORCID ID to their accounts in our online peer review platforms. It takes seconds to do: click the link when prompted, sign into your ORCID account and our systems are automatically updated. Your ORCID iD will become part of your accepted publication’s metadata, making your work attributable to you and only you. Your ORCID iD is published with your article so that fellow researchers reading your work can link to your ORCID profile and from there link to your other publications.

If you do not already have an ORCID iD please follow this [link](https://orcid.org/register) to create one or visit [our ORCID homepage](https://www.sagepub.com/orcid) to learn more.
